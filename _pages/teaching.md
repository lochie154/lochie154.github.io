There's no doubt that math and physics are two of the most fundamental academic disciplines out there. They serve as the foundation for all other sciences and provide the tools needed to understand and solve some of society's most pressing problems. Being able to think logically and solve complex problems is key to success in any field, and math and physics are the perfect disciplines for developing those skills.

I have a strong background in mathematics and have been teaching students of all ages for over 5 years. I am confident in my abilities to help students learn and improve their mathematical skills. I have taught primary school classes the foundations of STEM through the LEGO engineers program, tutored mathematics through agencies, and tutor demonstrated at university. I am always open to helping people with anything related to numbers. Just send me a message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
