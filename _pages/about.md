I am a researcher at heart. I love understanding how things work and why they work the way they do. My background is in Mathematical Physics, and I use mathematics as my tool to understand the world around me. I am particularly interested in using mathematics to understand more about the brain. I love chatting with people about science and generating new ideas from first principles.

Currently, I am doing independent research in computational neuroscience and constructor theory.
